Today I learned about Python:

Python input lines looks like this:

```
>>>
```
Python does math, in accordance with PEMDAS
Python also can store variable.
Such that
```
>>> us_dollars = 300
>>> exchange_rate = .65
>>> newMoney = us_dollars * exchange_rate
>>> newMoney
```
the above lines of inputed code would yield
```
>>> 195
```

Python takes strings. Concatenation works the same way that it does is JS.

print to console using print()

use str() when printing things to console to change anything into a string,
such as a number that you want to continue to store as a variable.
```
#use \n for a new line and \t for an indent or tab
```
