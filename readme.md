Today I learned about Python:

2016/08/23
Python input lines looks like this:
```
>>>
```
Python does math, in accordance with PEMDAS
Python also can store variable.
Such that
```
>>> us_dollars = 300
>>> exchange_rate = .65
>>> newMoney = us_dollars * exchange_rate
>>> newMoney
```
the above lines of inputed code would yield
```
>>> 195
```
